# java-http-client-api

A simple code that performs HTTP requests by using Java 11â€™s standardization of **HTTP Client API**

### Things I learnt:
- Using **HTTP Client API** to build REST API is much easier than using **HttpUrlConnection**
- The response body looks much better, similar to the JSON format
